# container-ee-wunder-toolbox-ubi9
UBI9-based Wunder operations toolbox for Podman-driven automation in offline and restricted environments.
Includes `ansible-navigator` in-container so automation does not depend on host Ansible tooling.

Dependency sources:
- RPM packages: `rpm-packages.txt`
- Python packages: `requirements.txt`
